# AzureQueueWatcher
Generate log file regarding the status of the queues in a Azure Storage Account.
This tool can be used from any computer as long as NodeJS is installed.


In combinaison with LogStash+Kibana (or other log forwarder + reporting) this 
can be very useful in order to monitor what is happening. Template regarding 
NewRelic and ElasticSearch are also provided (See Features).


This can be quite convenient to see if the queues are behaving as expected 
and how many items are in the poison queues.


 ___Soon___, triggers will be available
in order to send notification when certain threshold criteria are met.
